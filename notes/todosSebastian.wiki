== user stories ==
define some user stories (interview rene)
take into consideration the follwing lists and ideas (which are incomplete and might change over time).
=== major requirements  ===
* calculate probability (frequency) of a word, bigram, trigram,... given some corpus
* be able to use different estimators to estimate probabilities for the above use cases.
* output statistics about the probability space of a certain corpus
* output statistics about the probability space of a certain corpus with smoothing techniques
* check if a language model sums correctly to one (input ARPA file?)
* given a sequence of words predict the next word
* given a training and test corpus calculate training perplexity / entropy as well as those values of the test corpus on the training one
* be able to decide if calculates shoul take place in memory or on disc (this process could be somewhat automated depending on trainingscorpus size and memory limits
* decide weather to use a cache or index a language model
* be able to cope with test corpora that have vocab which is not consistent with trainings corpus
* be able to combine various language models
* be able to quickly cound some patterns
* be able to present some statistics about distributions

=== minor requirements ===
* be able to combine varios language models
* be able to differentiate if one would consider smoothing as staying within in the same probability space and just refining conditions or wether one is allowed to combina varios probability spaces.

== interfaces ==
* design interfaces that make people achieve these user stories.
* write example code of how to use the interfaces

== integrate other toolkits ==
* be able to integrate other toolkits into our "blueprints" of interfaces.
