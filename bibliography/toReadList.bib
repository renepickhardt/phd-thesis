  abstract = {We propose a new benchmark corpus to be used for measuring progress
	in statistical language modeling. With almost one billion words of
	training data, we hope this benchmark will be useful to quickly evaluate
	novel language modeling techniques, and to compare their contribution
	when combined with other advanced techniques. We show performance
	of several well-known types of language models, with the best results
	achieved with a recurrent neural network based language model. The
	baseline unpruned Kneser-Ney 5-gram model achieves perplexity 67.6;
	a combination of techniques leads to 35% reduction in perplexity,
	or 10% reduction in cross-entropy (bits), over that baseline. The
	benchmark is available as a code.google.com project; besides the
	scripts needed to rebuild the training/held-out data, it also makes
	available log-probability values for each word in each of ten held-out
	data sets, for each of the baseline n-gram models.},
