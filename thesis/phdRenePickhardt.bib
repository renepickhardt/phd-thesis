  abstract = {We introduce a novel approach for building language models based on
	a systematic, recursive exploration of skip n-gram models which are
	interpolated using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing. Our approach generalizes
	language models as it contains the classical interpolation with lower
	order models as a special case. In this paper we motivate, formalize
	and present our approach. In an extensive empirical experiment over
	English text corpora we demonstrate that our generalized language
	models lead to a substantial reduction of perplexity between 3.1%
	and 12.7% in comparison to traditional language models using modified
	Kneser-Ney smoothing. Furthermore, we investigate the behaviour over
	three other languages and a domain specific corpus where we observed
	consistent improvements. Finally, we also show that the strength
	of our approach lies in its ability to cope in particular with sparse
	training data. Using a very small training data set of only 736 KB
	text we yield improvements of even 25.7% reduction of perplexity.},
