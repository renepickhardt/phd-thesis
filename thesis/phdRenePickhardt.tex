%\part{Foundations (do I need parts as a split level)}
%if there where parts I'd have:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item basics (theory+emperical)
%\item working with GLM (application + indexing)
%\item summary future work etc...
%\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Introduction (x - y)}
this dissertation will mainly focus on \cite{own:typology:2013}
\section{Overview of the topic (x-y)}

\section{Running example (1 bis 2 pages)}
The core idea would be to choose an example or example setting of a person in his day life and show how he is confronted with all the various applications of generalized language models.
\begin{enumerate}
\item submitting text to a cellphone or search engine
\item handicaped people
\item speech recognition
\item text classification
\item WHAT ELSE?!? need to research applications
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Problems with implementations of current methods (20 pages)}
As it turns out many of the above mentioned algorithms have been implemented incorrectly. 
A lot of the time the reason is improper notation which for example leads to the fact that marginal probabilities are used like conditional probabilities and vice verca. 

\section{Test of correctness}
All methods from the last chapter could be proven to be correct.
But when we look at implementations and language modelling toolkits we frequently find many problems since a lot of formulas seem ambigious. 
In these cases the implementations need to be checked for correctnes. 

One simple yet very effective test for correctness is testing if the sum over the probability of all events that can occure is actually 1. 
This is one reason why in a computer enviroment we will never talk about language models but $n$-gram models. 
Even over finite alphabets there are infinite elements in the set of all sentences. 
This means that doing this test for correct implementation is impossible for a computer.

\chapter{Benchmark of Language model toolkits in terms of correctness (20 pages)}
as we saw in the last chapter a lot of times notation is arbitrary.
This means that we often have a choice. 
The first goal of this chapter is to test all the choices one can make for the well established methods in order to understand what is the best known language model. 
The second goal of this chapter is to test the existing implementations of the algorithms of correctness and be able to state which choices have been made by the toolkits.

\chapter{Generalized Language Models (20 pages)}
As we saw there exist good reasons to do backoff steps in language modelling. 
The question is why making the history one word shorter?
Another question is why actually making it shorter and not introducing a skip at the first position?
At this point one might wonder why not introducing skips at other positions? 
Introducing skips increases the probabilities. 
Maybe this is too much so we would like to introduce something that is not an arbitrary skip but also not a concrete word. Part of speeches seem to be reasonable though they could be replaced by any class leading to class based aproaches\cite{CLASS:BASED:LMS} or factored language models\cite{FACTORED:LANGUAGE:MODEL}.

Generalized Language models are a way to address these issues. 
They are fully compatible with the above mentioned smoothing methods. 

For the rest of this chapter we show how to define generalized language models and demonstrate their superiority in terms of perplexity. 
We will also demonstrate their downsides in terms of model parameter and storage space.

\section{Generalized ARPA format for Generalized Language Models}
Also talking about the decoder

\chapter{applications: next word prediction setting (5 pages)}
We will answer the question if generalized language models are only better in terms of perplexity or also outperforming in an application like next word prediction.
\chapter{applications: machine translation (5 pages)}
We will also aim to answer the question of performance in the setting of machine translation.
\chapter{Solving the Entropy Conjecture(10 - 15 pages)}
The conjecture states: Better results in Entropy of a LM will always positive correlate with better BLUE scores or Word error rates. The reason why this did not happen is that many implementations did not produce proper probability distributions.
\chapter{Open ends (3 pages)}
\section{Pruning}
\section{Indexing}
\section{Distributed implementation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item notation. 
\item already have a motivation with some statistics taken from wikipedia ?

\chapter{indexing of generalized language models}
first basic question: will indexing depend on the application ? I guess it does. but it sure makes sense to to be able to store generalized language models.
\section{filtering GLM to acertain size}
shall I make this?
\section{a data structure to store GLM}
also here no ideas and results available
